# Introduction

## OpenShift 101: Learn the Basics of Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud

A recent study by McKinsey & Company reveals that only 20 percent of enterprise applications have moved to the cloud. We believe that a hybrid cloud approach, built on open source and a vibrant open ecosystem, is the best way to move the remaining 80 percent.

Red Hat OpenShift represents a common platform, based on the industry-standard Kubernetes, that allows you to build on premises, on the IBM Cloud, or on any other leading cloud platform. You want freedom of choice; Red Hat OpenShift offers exactly that.

The goals of this workshop are:

* To familiarize the reader with OpenShift
* Deploy a Node.js application to OpenShift
* Use OpenShift's features to monitor, scale the application
